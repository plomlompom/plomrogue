 * selecting a random sea cell and transforming it into land if it is neighbor

 * A move is legal if "yx" ends up in the confines of the map and the original

 * current wrapping state is kept between successive calls until a "yx" of NULL
 * is passed, in which case the function does nothing but zero the wrap state.
 * Successive wrapping may move "yx" several wrap spaces into either direction,
 * or return it into the original wrap space.
