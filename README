plomrogue
=========

plomlompom tries to build his own roguelike. Currently, it doesn't do
much, apart from managing some example ncurses windows in a bizarre 
fashion. You can move around a player and meet an enemy, but they don't
really fight. The map gets generated randomly. There is only one save
file (named "savefile"), and it gets overwritten each new turn. To start
over with a new world, delete it.
