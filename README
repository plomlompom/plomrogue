plomrogue
=========

plomlompom tries to build his own roguelike. Currently, it doesn't do
much, apart from managing some example ncurses windows in a bizarre 
fashion. You can move around a player and meet an enemy, but they don't
really fight. A map gets generated randomly; it's seed can be saved and
later reloaded.

Install/run
