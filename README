plomrogue
=========

plomlompom tries to build his own roguelike. Currently, it doesn't do much
interesting, apart from managing keybindings and some ncurses windows in a
bizarre fashion.

You can move around a player and meet a number of different enemies. They move
randomly and will only accidentally hit you. You have 5 hitpoints to lose before
death; they have either 1, 3 or 9. Your score grows by killing enemies, to the
amount of hitpoints each killed enemy started with.

The map get generated randomly, too.

There is only one save file (named "savefile"), and it gets overwritten each new
turn. To start over with a new world, delete it.

Install/run
-----------

Dependencies: the ncurses library.

git clone https://github.com/plomlompom/plomrogue
cd plomrogue
make
./roguelike

Keybindings and window configuration
------------------------------------

In the default window configuration, globally available keybinings are shown at
game start in the three windows on the left of the screen. The lower two windows
describe keybindings / actions only available in a window's window configuration
views -- hit "w" (per default keybindings) to switch the selected / "active"
window to a view that allows changing its geometry. One further hit on "w"
switches the window to a view that lists keybindings available specifically for
that window -- such as for map scrolling actions in the "map" window. All
keybindings can be changed.

What actions are available globally or only in specific windows can be further
manipulated by editing the files config/keybindings_global and
config/windows/Win_* that map keycodes to commands to the respective keybinding
repositories. While keybindings_global contains merely a list of keycode command
mappings, the Win_* files start with the name of the windows to be configured,
followed by a one-character line for internal use (mapping the window to one of
several internally available window content drawing functions), followed by two
lines describing the window's designated height and width, and only then an
optional list of keybindings specific to that window.

Replay game recording
---------------------

Run "./roguelike -s" to watch a recording of the current game from the
beginning. Hit the "next turn / wait" key to increment turns. Keys to
manage windows, scroll on the map and quit the program are active; keys
to perform player actions are inactive. Append a number to the -s option
(like "-s100") to start the recording at the respective turn number.
