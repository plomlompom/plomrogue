7DRL 2015 project: Please the Island God
========================================

Description
-----------

See <http://www.plomlompom.de/PlomRogue/plomwiki.php?title=7DRL2015Day2>
and <http://www.plomlompom.de/PlomRogue/plomwiki.php?title=7DRL2015Day3>.

System requirements / installation / running the game
-----------------------------------------------------

The game is expected to run:
- on Unix systems with a vt100-like terminal environment (xterm will do)
- that contain the ncurses library
- and Python3 (version >= 3.2.3).

To build it, this is furthermore necessary:
- gcc (version >= 4.7.2); some llvm masked as gcc was tested successfully on OSX
- libc library headers (libc6-dev?)
- ncurses library headers (libncurses5-dev?)

To build and start, do the following steps:

$ ./redo
$ ./roguelike

(If you got a version of djb's redo build system installed and in your $PATH,
you could also do a simple "redo" instead of "./redo". The ./redo script calls a
simple partial shell script implementation of redo stored below
./build/redo_scripts/, written by Nils Dagsson Moskopp a.k.a. erlehmann.)

There are two executables ./roguelike-server and ./roguelike-client.
./roguelike is a pre-existing shell script that merely executes both of them,
with the server as a background job. You can also ignore the script and start
any of the two by hand.

Keybindings
-----------

a - let AI decide move

w - move north-west
e - move north-east
s - move west
d - move east
x - move south-west
c - move south-east

l - toggle "look" mode, investigate map cells by moving a cursor over the map
    instead of the player avatar

p - pick up item
D - drop item selected in inventory
u - use item selected in inventory

UP - navigate upwards in Inventory
DOWN - navigate downwards in inventory

Replay game recording
---------------------

Once you start a new world, every move of yours is recorded in a file called
"record". It gets overwritten when a new game world is started after deletion
of the "savefile" file. Run "./roguelike -s" to watch the current game's
recording from the beginning. Hit any player action key to increment turns (they
will not trigger the actions usually mapped to them, only repeat the actions
done at that point in the game as defined in the "record" file). Keys to manage
windows, scroll on the map and quit the program do their usual thing. Append a
number to the -s option (like "-s100") to start the recording at the respective
turn number.

Hacking / server internals and configuration
--------------------------------------------

The game world is set up and made subject to player commands by
./roguelike-server. It's controlled by commands explained in the file
./SERVER_COMMANDS. The server usually reads these from the files ./server/in
(written to by ./roguelike-client), ./confserver/world, ./record and ./savefile.

All source files are thoroughly documented to explain more details of
plomrogue's internals. The ./roguelike-server executable can be run with a -v
option for helpful debugging info (mostly: what messages the client sends to the
server). Server and client communicate via files in the ./server/ directory
(generated when the server is first run). The ./server/in file is read by the
server for newline-delimited commands. The ./server/out file contains server
messages to be read by clients. The ./server/worldstate file contains a
serialized representation of the game world's data as it is to be visible to
the player / the player's client.
