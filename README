plomrogue
=========

plomlompom tries to build his own roguelike. Currently, it doesn't do
much interesting, apart from managing some ncurses windows in a bizarre
fashion.

You can move around a player and meet a number of different enemies.
They move randomly and will only accidentally hit you. You have 5
hitpoints to lose before death; they have either 1, 3 or 9. Your score
grows by killing enemies, to the amount of hitpoints each killed enemy
started with.

The map get generated randomly, too.

There is only one save file (named "savefile"), and it gets overwritten
each new turn. To start over with a new world, delete it.

Replay game recording
---------------------

Run "./roguelike -s" to watch a recording of the current game from the
beginning. Hit the "next turn / wait" key to increment turns. Keys to
manage windows, scroll on the map and quit the program are active; keys
to perform player actions are inactive. Append a number to the -s option
(like "-s100") to start the recording at the respective turn number.
