Next planned steps in plomrogue development:

IN GENERAL:

- expand use of hardcoded_strings module(s)

BOTH SERVER/CLIENT:

- make server and client communicate by specific world state info requests 
  in server/out, replacing server/worldstate

CLIENT:

- split Available keys window in two (Global keys (maybe drop that, replace it
  by F6 window), Active window's keys)

- re-work unnecessary complex command / keybinding / server message mapping

BUILD PROCESS:

- erlehmann's redo scripts are not OSX-compliant, see:
  <https://github.com/plomlompom/plomrogue/issues/2>
