Next planned steps in plomrogue development:

IN GENERAL:

- expand use of hardcoded_strings module(s)

- use __func__ instead of f_name

BOTH SERVER/CLIENT:

- make server and client communicate by specific world state info requests 
  in server/out, replacing server/worldstate

SERVER:

- consider

- save confserver/world data in record and save file, too; handle them like god
  commands

- rectify the mentioning of line counts in command reading error messages

CLIENT:

- enable toggling of window borders

- make log scrollable

- re-work unnecessary complex command / keybinding / server message mapping
