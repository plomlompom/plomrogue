Next planned steps in plomrogue development:

BOTH SERVER/CLIENT:

- implement better server/client architecture, meeting these criteria:
  - keep interaction of server and client in the filesystem (as currently
    happens by use of plain text files and fifos) to allow for easy scripting
  - allow for specific requests of the client for specific server data (such as:
    "what path do you propose for the player character to get from A to B?")
  - reduce hard disk i/o for server/client interaction (use fifos only?)
  - further avoid exits that keep the server running and the lock file existing
    when it shouldn't

- check for return values of *printf()

SERVER:

- implement field of view / line of sight and obstacles for those on the map

- get rid of the hard-coding of the MAGIC MEAT item type and its use mode

- is it actually useful to define map object action ids in the config file?

- make shape of map (and diagonal movement penalty) configurable in config file

CLIENT:

- enable toggling of window borders

- enable toggling of showing "\n" in the window content either as newline breaks
  (as currently) or as " / " (without newline break) for more efficent screen
  estate use

- does get_n_of_keybs() really need to be its own function? (only used once)

- transform Keybindings struct series from a linked list into an array
