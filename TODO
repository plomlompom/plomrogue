Next planned steps in plomrogue development:

BOTH SERVER/CLIENT:

- expand use of hardcoded_strings module(s)

- make server and client communicate by specific world state info requests 
  in server/out, replacing server/worldstate

- quote escaping in token_from_line()

- think about refactoring occurrences of "free(...); ... = NULL;"

SERVER:

- pythonize Python code

- old C code: pythonize, then re-C as needed by performance

CLIENT:

- re-work unnecessary complex command / keybinding / server message mapping

- only send "ITEM_HERE" query to server when the dependent window is open
