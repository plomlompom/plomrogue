Next planned steps in plomrogue development:

IN GENERAL:

- expand use of hardcoded_strings module(s)

BOTH SERVER/CLIENT:

- make server and client communicate by specific world state info requests 
  in server/out, replacing server/worldstate

SERVER

- document server commands

CLIENT:

- enable toggling of window borders

- make log scrollable

- re-work unnecessary complex command / keybinding / server message mapping
