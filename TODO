Next planned steps in plomrogue development:

BOTH SERVER/CLIENT:

- expand use of hardcoded_strings module(s)

- make server and client communicate by specific world state info requests 
  in server/out, replacing server/worldstate

- quote escaping in token_from_line()

- do something about common crashes caused by server/client miscommunication

SERVER:

- fix hardcoded MAGIC MEAT eating message in thing_actions.c

CLIENT:

- re-work unnecessary complex command / keybinding / server message mapping

- only send "ITEM_HERE" query to server when the dependent window is open

BUILD PROCESS:

- erlehmann's redo scripts are not OSX-compliant, see:
  <https://github.com/plomlompom/plomrogue/issues/2>
