Next planned steps in plomrogue development:

BOTH SERVER/CLIENT:

- make server and client communicate by specific world state info requests 
  in server/out, replacing server/worldstate

- check for return values of *printf()

- be more strict and humble when allocating memory from the stack

- in textfield_width(), handle too large lines somehow

- may err_line store the processed line internally as it does the line count

SERVER:

- implement field of view / line of sight and obstacles for those on the map

- is it actually useful to define map object action ids in the config file?

- make shape of map (and diagonal movement penalty) configurable in config file

- for game continuation, replace re-playing of whole record files with loading
  game state snapshots / save files

- why does an MapObjAct id of 0 fail?

CLIENT:

- enable toggling of window borders

- make log scrollable

- implement server-config-file-like parsing for client-config-files, too
