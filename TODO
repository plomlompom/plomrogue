Next planned steps in plomrogue development:

IN GENERAL:

- check for return values of *printf()

- be more strict and humble when allocating memory from the stack

- expand use of hardcoded_strings module(s)

BOTH SERVER/CLIENT:

- make server and client communicate by specific world state info requests 
  in server/out, replacing server/worldstate

SERVER:

- consider

- save confserver/world data in record and save file, too; handle them like god
  commands

- ensure atomic re-writing of savefile

CLIENT:

- enable toggling of window borders

- make log scrollable

- do something about a growing log slowing down the client

- enable auto-focus of map view on player
