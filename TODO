Next planned steps in plomrogue development:

BOTH SERVER/CLIENT:

- make server and client communicate by specific world state info requests 
  in server/out, replacing server/worldstate

- check for return values of *printf()

- make config files format more readable / self-explanatory

- in startup script, pipe server output to log file instead of stdout

SERVER:

- implement field of view / line of sight and obstacles for those on the map

- get rid of the hard-coding of the MAGIC MEAT item type and its use mode

- is it actually useful to define map object action ids in the config file?

- make shape of map (and diagonal movement penalty) configurable in config file

CLIENT:

- enable toggling of window borders

- make log scrollable
