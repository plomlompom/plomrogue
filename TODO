Next planned steps in plomrogue development:

IN GENERAL:

- expand use of hardcoded_strings module(s)

SERVER:

- handle case of actors hitting the map edge

BOTH SERVER/CLIENT:

- make server and client communicate by specific world state info requests 
  in server/out, replacing server/worldstate

CLIENT:

- re-work unnecessary complex command / keybinding / server message mapping

BUILD PROCESS:

- erlehmann's redo scripts are not OSX-compliant, see:
  <https://github.com/plomlompom/plomrogue/issues/2>
